Implementation of a simple Microservice framework, which i will use it to implement a system.

In the Microservices architecture, complex applications are composed of small and independent services that are able to communicate with each other using messages. 

The Microservice architecture allows us to compose a large program from a collection of smaller independent parts.

This project is composed of two main sections:

1. Building a simple Microservice framework.
   
3. Implementing a system on top of this framework.
