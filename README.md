In this project i will help flattening the curve, by writing a C++ program that simulates a contact tracing system.

The program simulates a social network (represented as a graph), in which an epidemic is spreading, and contact tracers are searching for infected people, trace their contacts, and attempt to break the chain of infection.

The program will receive a config file (json) as an input, which includes the description of the social network graph, a list of agents (viruses and contact tracers), and additional settings.
